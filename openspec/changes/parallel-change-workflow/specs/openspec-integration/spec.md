## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit workflow authority
The integration package SHALL act only for explicitly adopted OpenSpec scope and
SHALL NOT create a second CAP/CHG task tracker or infer authority from installation.

#### Scenario: Existing legacy consumer
- **WHEN** a project has not explicitly migrated
- **THEN** its existing CAP/CHG packages and launch boundaries remain available unchanged

#### Scenario: Planning-only request
- **WHEN** the operator approves only planning
- **THEN** no executor, Git publication, integration or task execution is authorized

### Requirement: Immutable review identity
The guard SHALL bind approval to committed planning content and review to an exact
committed candidate, while permitting only task-checkbox progress changes to preserve
the plan digest.

#### Scenario: Changed task definition
- **WHEN** a task or gate changes after plan approval
- **THEN** the previous plan digest is rejected

#### Scenario: Changed candidate
- **WHEN** the candidate SHA changes after review
- **THEN** the previous review cannot satisfy the candidate gate

### Requirement: Truthful integrated evidence
The guard SHALL require successful exact-revision gate evidence, candidate integration
ancestry and conservative freshness before accepting a post-merge receipt structurally.

#### Scenario: Independent clone
- **WHEN** the required Git objects are present in another clone
- **THEN** evidence validation does not require a shared Git common directory

#### Scenario: Failed or stale verification
- **WHEN** a gate failed or unverified product content changed after verification
- **THEN** receipt validation fails without repairing or discarding work

### Requirement: Isolated package choice
The distribution SHALL preserve complete legacy packages and expose the OpenSpec
integration bundle without implicit orchestration or a second phase skill set.

#### Scenario: OpenSpec bundle inventory
- **WHEN** the OpenSpec plugin ZIP is built
- **THEN** it contains integration, commit and wireframe packages only, byte-for-byte
